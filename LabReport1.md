# Installing VSCode

# Remotely Connecting

1. Open your MacOS Terminal
2. Input this into your terminal: `$ ssh cs15lsp23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu` but change the `zz` to your own unique letters in your account username. If you are connecting to the server for the first time, you should see this message:

```
⤇ ssh cs15lsp23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
The authenticity of host 'ieng6.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? 
```

If you see this message, type 'yes' and hit enter. 

3. Next, you should see a password prompt. Enter in the password to your account. If your password hasn't been updated/is entered wrongly, the terminal will prompt you to enter the password in again (if you recently changed your password, it may take some time to update. Revisit this at a later time). Once you are logged in, you should see these messages:
